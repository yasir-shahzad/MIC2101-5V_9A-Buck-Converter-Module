# The CH32V003 Family of 32-bit RISC-V Microcontrollers
## Overview
The CH32V003 series is a collection of industrial-grade general-purpose microcontrollers that utilize the QingKe RISC-V2A core design supporting the RV32EC instruction set. These microcontrollers are equipped with various features such as a 48MHz system main frequency, 16KB flash, 2KB SRAM, wide voltage support (2.7V - 5.5V), a single-wire serial debug interface, low power consumption, and an ultra-small package. Additionally, the CH32V003 series includes a built-in set of components including a DMA controller, a 10-bit ADC, op-amp comparators, multiple timers, and standard communication interfaces such as USART, I2C, and SPI.

# Programming and Debugging
## WCH-LinkE
To program the CH32V003 microcontroller, you will need a special programming device which utilizes the proprietary single-wire serial debug interface (SDI). The [WCH-LinkE](http://www.wch-ic.com/products/WCH-Link.html) (pay attention to the "E" in the name) is a suitable device for this purpose and can be purchased commercially for around $3. This debugging tool is not only compatible with the CH32V003 but also with other WCH RISC-V and ARM-based microcontrollers. WCH offers free but closed-source software options for the PC side, such as [MounRiver Studio](http://www.mounriver.com/) and [WCH-LinkUtility](https://www.wch.cn/downloads/WCH-LinkUtility_ZIP.html).

You can also use the Python tool rvprog.py for flashing the CH32V003 microcontroller with the WCH-LinkE. It is provided with the examples in the software folder. Alternatively, there is a platform-independent open-source tool called minichlink developed by Charles Lohr (CNLohr), which can be found [here](https://github.com/cnlohr/ch32v003fun/tree/master/minichlink). Additionally, a customized version of [OpenOCD](https://github.com/karlp/openocd-hacks) can be used for uploading firmware. More information can be found [here](https://github.com/wuxx/nanoCH32V003).

![CH32V003_wch-linke.jpg](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wagiminator/Development-Boards/main/CH32V003F4P6_DevBoard/documentation/CH32V003_wch-linke.jpg)

To use the WCH-LinkE on Linux, you need to grant access permissions beforehand by executing the following commands:
```
echo 'SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTR{idVendor}=="1a86", ATTR{idProduct}=="8010", MODE="666"' | sudo tee /etc/udev/rules.d/99-WCH-LinkE.rules
echo 'SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTR{idVendor}=="1a86", ATTR{idProduct}=="8012", MODE="666"' | sudo tee -a /etc/udev/rules.d/99-WCH-LinkE.rules
sudo udevadm control --reload-rules
```

To upload firmware and perform debugging, you need to ensure that the development board is disconnected from any power sources. Then, you should make the following connections to the WCH-LinkE:

```
WCH-LinkE      DevBoard
+-------+      +------+
|  SWDIO| <--> |DIO   |
|    GND| ---> |GND   |
|    3V3| ---> |3V3   |
+-------+      +------+
```

If the blue LED on the WCH-LinkE remains illuminated once it is connected to the USB port, it means that the device is currently in ARM mode and must be switched to RISC-V mode initially. There are a few ways to accomplish this:
- You can utilize the Python tool called rvmode.py, which is provided with the examples in the software folder.
- Alternatively, you can select "WCH-LinkRV" in the software provided by WCH, such as MounRiver Studio or WCH-LinkUtility.
- Another option is to hold down the ModeS button on the device while plugging it into the USB port.

More information can be found in the [WCH-Link User Manual](http://www.wch-ic.com/downloads/WCH-LinkUserManual_PDF.html).

## Open-Source Debugging Devices
As part of his [ch32v003fun](https://github.com/cnlohr/ch32v003fun) project, Charles Lohr has also developed open-source programmers/debuggers based on STM32F042 and ESP32S2. Furthermore, the schematic diagram of the WCH-LinkE based on the CH32V305F is available on the manufacturer's [website](https://www.wch.cn/products/WCH-Link.html), but the [firmware](https://github.com/openwch/ch32v003) can only be downloaded as a binary file.

# Software Development Tools
## MounRiver Studio IDE
The Eclipse-based closed-source [MounRiver Studio IDE](http://www.mounriver.com/) is the official development environment provided by WCH. It supports Windows, Linux, and Mac. MounRiver Studio can be downloaded for free.

## Open-Source GCC-based Toolchain
You can download a complete toolchain (GCC and OpenOCD) for Linux and Mac from the MounRiver Studio website. However, the provided examples here are based on the [MCU Templates](https://github.com/wagiminator/MCU-Templates) project.

To install the toolchain on Linux, you can use the following commands:

```
sudo apt install build-essential libnewlib-dev gcc-riscv64-unknown-elf
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip
python3 -m pip install pyusb
```

You can also use the [ch32003fun SDK](https://github.com/cnlohr/ch32v003fun) by CNLohr. Follow the instructions on the Github page to install the toolchain.

## Arduino IDE and PlatformIO Support
There are projects around to make the CH32V003 compatible with the Arduino IDE ([arduino_core_ch32](https://github.com/openwch/arduino_core_ch32) and [arduino-wch32v003](https://github.com/AlexanderMandera/arduino-wch32v003)) and PlatformIO ([platform-ch32v](https://github.com/Community-PIO-CH32V/platform-ch32v)).
